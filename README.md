# Recipe Management System

## Overview
The Recipe Management System is a web application designed to provide users with a platform to manage their recipes. Users can perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on recipes, view the total list of ingredients for all recipes, search for specific recipes using a search function, and favorite recipes for easy access. The system also includes an authentication section for user login and registration.

## Features
1. **Recipe Management**: Users can create new recipes, edit existing recipes, and delete recipes. Each recipe consists of a title, description, ingredients, and instructions. Users can easily organize and update their collection of recipes.

2. **Ingredient List**: The system provides a consolidated view of all ingredients used in the user's recipes. This allows users to easily check ingredient availability and plan their shopping list accordingly.

3. **Recipe Search**: Users can quickly find specific recipes using the search functionality. The search feature allows users to search by recipe title, ingredients, or any related keywords. This saves time and effort in locating desired recipes.

4. **Favorites**: Users can mark recipes as favorites for quick access. The favorites feature enables users to easily filter and view their preferred recipes, making it convenient to find frequently used recipes.

5. **Authentication**: The system includes a secure authentication mechanism for user registration and login. This ensures that only authorized users can access and manage their recipes.
